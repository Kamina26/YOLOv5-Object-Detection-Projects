# YOLOv5 Object Detection Projects
This repository contains several projects that utilize the YOLOv5 framework for object detection. YOLOv5 is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can be used for a wide range of applications.

### 1. Pre-trained YOLOv5 Model Detection
- **Description**: This part of the project demonstrates the use of pre-trained YOLOv5 models to detect objects in images and videos.
- **How to Use**:
  - Clone the repository and install required packages.
  - Run the detection script on your images or videos using pre-trained weights.

### 2. Custom Dataset Training and Detection
- **Description**: This section focuses on creating a custom dataset, training the YOLOv5 model on it, and performing detection.
- **Dataset**: Images and corresponding annotation files are sourced from a specified directory, split into training and validation sets.
- **How to Use**:
  - Prepare your images and annotations.
  - Adjust the dataset configuration file as needed.
  - Run the training script to train your model.

### 3. Roboflow Integration
- **Description**: This part integrates the Roboflow platform for dataset management. It allows users to easily download datasets and train YOLOv5 models.
- **How to Use**:
  - Create a project on Roboflow, obtain your API key, and set up your dataset.
  - Use the provided script to download the dataset and train the model.

required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
